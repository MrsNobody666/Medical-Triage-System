HEALTHCARE DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN
A Comprehensive Strategy for Sourcing, Validating, and Ensuring Healthcare Data Quality

================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document presents a systematic approach to healthcare data collection and quality assurance, designed to ensure reliable, accurate, and actionable healthcare data for research and decision-making purposes. The plan encompasses identification of public healthcare data sources, establishment of rigorous selection criteria, implementation of comprehensive validation methodologies, and development of robust risk mitigation strategies.

The healthcare data landscape presents unique challenges including privacy regulations, data fragmentation across systems, varying quality standards, and the critical importance of accuracy for patient safety. This plan addresses these challenges through evidence-based methodologies drawn from leading healthcare organizations, academic research, and government health agencies.

7.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR APPROACH

The multi-layer validation approach is justified by research demonstrating that single-method validation is insufficient for healthcare data quality assurance. The combination of automated checks, manual review, and statistical validation provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining efficiency.

The ten-dimensional quality framework (accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, accessibility, validity, currency, identifiability, provenance, usability) is based on established healthcare data quality standards and addresses the unique requirements of clinical research and patient safety applications.

Risk mitigation strategies are designed based on evidence from healthcare data quality studies showing that proactive risk identification and systematic mitigation significantly reduce data quality issues and improve research validity.
